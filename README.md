This project is an analysis of my academic performance in MIT, Manipal. It includes graphs to visualize my performance across the semesters. The factors considered to measure performance in each semester are: 
1. GPA
2. Total marks obtained in theory subjects (excluding finals)
3. Total internal marks obtained in Labs (excluding finals)
4. Aggregate midterm marks 
5. Aggregate in-semester tests marks 

Finals are excluded as the marks are not made available to students unless applied for.
